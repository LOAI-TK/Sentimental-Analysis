# Sentiment Analysis with BERT

This repository contains an exploratory workflow for performing sentiment analysis on text reviews using Hugging Face's BERT-based multilingual model. The project is structured as a Jupyter Notebook and demonstrates data cleaning, model inference, and insights generation.

⚠️ Note: The dataset used in this notebook comes from a private company. For confidentiality reasons, the raw data is not included in this repository. To replicate the workflow, you will need to supply your own dataset of text reviews.


# Project Phases

## 1. Data Cleaning

The notebook starts by cleaning and preparing the raw dataset of reviews. This phase includes:

- Removing HTML tags, special characters, and extra spaces.

- Normalizing text (lowercasing, stripping whitespace).

- Filtering out missing or irrelevant entries.

- Tokenizing text where appropriate.


## 2. Sentiment Analysis

In this phase, we apply Hugging Face's pretrained model nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment, which is capable of handling multiple languages. Steps include:

- Feeding cleaned reviews into the model.

- Generating sentiment predictions on a 3-class scale:

  1 = Negative

  2 = Neutral

  3 = Positive

- Handling batch predictions for efficiency.

- Storing predictions alongside the original data for further analysis.

## 3. Sentiment Insights Report

The final phase focuses on drawing insights from the model predictions:

- Aggregating sentiment scores across the dataset.

- Visualizing sentiment distribution with bar plots and histograms.

- Identifying common patterns, such as the proportion of negative vs. positive reviews.

- Comparing sentiment across different subgroups

# Results

- After running the notebook, you will obtain:

- A cleaned dataset of reviews ready for NLP tasks.

- Sentiment predictions (Negative, Neutral, Positive) for each review.

## Visual insights such as:

- Distribution of reviews across sentiment categories.

- Trends in customer opinions.

- Example charts showing how sentiment varies across subsets of data.

### Example Output

- Below are example plots generated by the notebook:

- Sentiment Distribution: A histogram showing the count of reviews by sentiment (Negative, Neutral, Positive).

- Category-Level Sentiment: If metadata is present, bar charts showing sentiment per category.

- Time Series Trends: Line charts of sentiment over time (if timestamp data is available).

# Model Reference

This project uses Hugging Face's BERT multilingual sentiment model. The model was adapted to output 3 sentiment classes (Negative, Neutral, Positive) instead of the original 5-star ratings.
